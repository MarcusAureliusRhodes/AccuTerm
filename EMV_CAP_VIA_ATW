! Begin capture. Mode o may be O (overwrite),  A  (append),  N  (new  file
! only) or C (clipboard).  Source p may be P to capture  printed  data  or
! null to capture received data.  t may be T (text) to capture  text  only
! (filters out control characters) or null for no filtering.  Path is  the
! drive, directory and file name where the captured data is to be  stored.
! All characters  received  (or  printed)  are  stored  in  the  file  (or
! clipboard) until capturing is disabled (via local or remote command).

! Note: when capturing to the clipboard, path is ignored.

!  ESC STX C X

! End capture.  The file containing the captured data is closed.

   CRT ESC : STX : EXE_MODE : CMD_LINE : CR :

! Saves a copy of the specified screen  block  (text,  colors  and  visual
! effects) and terminal state in memory and associates the block with  the
! specified identifier (ID) which can be an arbitrary alpha-numeric string
! (may not contain commas). Any number of screen blocks can be saved.  Col
! and row specify the upper-left corner of the block. If either is omitted
! or null, zero is assumed. Width and  height  specify  the  size  of  the
! block. If width or height is omitted or null, the screen width or height
! is used. Page optionally specifies the terminal page for the block,  and
! if omitted or null, the current page is used.
