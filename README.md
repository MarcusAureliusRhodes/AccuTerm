# AccuTerm

These are Evolution/MV's AccuTerm utilities.

What are they?

First, AccuTerm is a phenomenally powerful terminal emulator comparable to SystemBuilder, but, like SystemBuilder, its GUI features can be quite daunting, akin to swatting flies with Buicks, so most programmers, most often faced with writing a simple report or extraction, will simply forego bothering with any of AccuTerm's GUI tools.  Worse still, getting anyone to convert existing applications to GUI is almost always countered with the question, "Am I going to have to rewrite my application as subroutines?"

Before shooting back with the obvious, "WHAT?!  You haven't already done that?!"  Try my utilities.  Patterened after Zenity, they allow you to graft the most crucial, and frequently used, GUI features onto existing, legacy applications with minimal aleration, and WITHOUT rewriting anything as subroutines.  They also allow you to write new applications with GUI features in far less time than anything else will.

All these programs are subroutines, so they are easy, drop-in replacements for existing code, and include a very GUI file-selector, date-picker, date-range-picker, message-box, menu, list-box, input field, credentials dialog, dialogs with flexible buttons (Yes/No, Previous/Next, Continue/Cancel), as well as an optional Help button.

Pepper your programs with these, and you'll not only delight your users by giving them a much more intuitive user-interface, but you'll also derail any inclination to 'replace that stodgy, old Pick system with something more modern'.
